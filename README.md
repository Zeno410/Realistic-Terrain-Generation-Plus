# Overview

Realistic Terrain Generation Plus is a fork of RTG that adds extensive and immersive variety to forests, which vary in tree composition, height, and density. It adds on to RTG's extensive terrain variability, broad navigable rivers and lakes, soaring mountains, rolling hills, and sweeping plains. The current version of Geographicraft is strongly recommended for increased landscape variety, but RTG+ is still great with vanilla layout.

### Credits
----
This mod is forked from RTG due mostly to access issues with the RTG mod page.

RTG is brought to you by [Team RTG](https://github.com/Team-RTG) and contains a number of [contributions](https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/graphs/contributors) from various members of the Minecraft modding community. It also uses KdotJPG's [OpenSimplex Noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19) to generate its terrain.

RTG, in turn, is a re-branded fork of the revolutionary [Realistic World Gen](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281910-teds-world-gen-mods-realistic-world-gen-alpha-1-3) mod by ted80. It was created as a new project because it was expected to deviate from ted80's original vision for RWG, and the author of this mod didn't want to interfere with that vision.
